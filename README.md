Your app is not ready to be deployed! should make some changes
TODO

# Add pagination. Possibly infinte scroll. For the moment just the first page is shown.

# Be able to download images in original size (high resolution).

# Add other type of media assets, not just images, the API also offers images and audios. In this case also a # video and audio player has to be implemented.

# Add end-to-end tests.
